It doesn't consider threads as workers and looks for individual workers to do the job. The result would be you will not see a collect() to converge.\n",
    "- master is a Spark, Mesos or YARN cluster URL, or a special “local[*]” string to run in local mode. In practice, when running on a cluster, you will not want to hardcode master in the program, but rather launch the application with spark-submit and receive it there. However, for local testing and unit tests, you can pass “local[*]” to run Spark Streaming in-process (detects the number of cores in the local system)."
